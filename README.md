# Web SQL Client

Manage your SQL database from a web app, cause it's 2019.

## Building

`npm run build` to build the frontend, then `mvn package` to package the frontend and backend. A runnable .jar should be generated in `target/`.<br>
`npm start` sets up a development server that watches the frontend files.
